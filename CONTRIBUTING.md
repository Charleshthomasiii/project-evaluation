## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The more evaluations we have, the better.
If you find information in any of these evaluations that you think might
be improved, updated, or corrected because it is just not accurate, please
consider creating an issue and then (optionally) a pull request with the fix.
If you are working on the pull request for the issue you reported, state so in the issue itself so nobody else starts on working on the fix. 

Anyone can contribute to this repository by following the instructions in
the README.md file and issuing a pull request to this repository.
