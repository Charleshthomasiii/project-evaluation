** Summary
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: summary
   :END:

1. Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to
   contribute in the course of a few weeks before the end of this
   semester?

   Yes. The Installation (like the php install.php not the actual deploy) can be
   improved for example.

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project?

   No. PHP bad.

   On serious note, I have no interest in maintaining an old CRM/CMS system and
   am not willing to write PHP. It seems the project does not have an open bug
   bounty program either.
